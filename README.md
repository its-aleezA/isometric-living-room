# 🏠 Isometric Living Room – Blender Project

A cozy isometric 3D room created in Blender as part of my Computer Graphics elective, following the tutorial by 3DGreenhorn to learn fundamental 3D modeling and scene composition techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created by following the "Isometric Living Room" tutorial series by 3DGreenhorn on YouTube. All credit for the original design and teaching methodology goes to the tutorial creator.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Complete isometric scene** with furniture and decor
- ✅ **Realistic lighting** and material setup
- ✅ **Non-destructive workflow** with proper scene organization
- ✅ **Stylized aesthetic** suitable for social media content

## 📖 Overview

This project represents my first complete 3D scene in Blender, created as part of my computer graphics coursework. The isometric living room demonstrates fundamental 3D modeling principles, material creation, lighting techniques, and scene composition in an isometric perspective.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Blender 3.6+** (download from [blender.org](blender.org))
- Basic understanding of Blender interface (learned from tutorial)

### 2. Opening the Project
```bash
# Download the .blend file and open in Blender
blender isometric_living_room.blend
```
### 3. Rendering the Scene
- Set your preferred render engine (Cycles or Eevee)
- Adjust render settings as needed
- Press F12 to render or Ctrl+F12 to render animation
  
### 4. Follow the Tutorial
